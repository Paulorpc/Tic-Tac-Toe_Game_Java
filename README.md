# Tic-Tac-Toe_Game_Java

University project to build a tic tac toe game (Jogo da Velha) in Java, aimed to be invensible against human interaction. In other words, the computer must not lose when playing against human (Computer vs Human mode). It was created in the simplest way just to accomplish the task, once the focus was the game strategy and the language learning/trainning.
